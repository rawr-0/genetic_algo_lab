# genetic_algo_lab
student project on the implementation of a genetic algorithm

A student project is a task undertaken by a student to demonstrate their knowledge and skills in a particular area of study. In this case, the project is focused on creating a program that uses a genetic algorithm to find the minimum of a given function within specified bounds.

A genetic algorithm is a search technique inspired by natural selection and genetics that is used to find solutions to optimization and search problems. In this project, the genetic algorithm is used to iteratively generate and evaluate candidate solutions until the best solution is found.

The program uses a selection method to choose the most promising individuals for reproduction. The intermediate recombination or single-point crossover is used to generate new candidate solutions by combining the genetic information of two individuals. The elite selection ensures that the best solutions found so far are preserved in the population.

To further increase the diversity of the population, the program also includes a mutation coefficient that introduces small random changes in the genetic information of the individuals.

To make the program easy to use, was created a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to input the function, bounds, and other parameters, as well as visualize the progress of the algorithm.

Overall, the project is a great example of how genetic algorithms can be used to solve optimization problems/
